**⚠️ PRELEASE, Work In Progress**

**Flux** is a universal WebAPI Client. It introduces an intuitive way for your software to communicate with external systems, whether they use REST, SOAP, or some other communication standard.

> ℹ️
> This package has no relation to the [Flux SPA Architecture](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-introduction-to-the-flux-architectural-pattern-674ea74775c9/) proposed by facebook. This is a WebAPI Client, and not a state management library. BitzArt.Flux can successfully work in conjunction with state management libraries inspired by Flux Architecture, such as [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [Fluxor](https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor), and others.

Refer to the [**documentation**](https://github.com/BitzArt/Flux/blob/main/docs/README.md) for further details.
