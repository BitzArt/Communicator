## Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Flux - a nuget package that simplifies interactions with external services.
  
### What is Flux?

Flux is an abstraction between your application and external services. It allows you to interact with external services in a simple and consistent way.

### The goal

The goal of Flux is to remove the necessity of worrying about the implementation details of external services and to allow you to focus on your application's logic.

### The Main Principle

The main principle behind the development of Flux is the [**Dependency Inversion Principle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle). We believe that your application logic should not depend on the implementation details of external services, but rather on abstractions.

### What is Flux designed to be

- **Easy to use** - Flux provides a simple and intuitive API for interacting with external services.

- **Configurable** - Flux is highly configurable and can be easily adapted to your needs.

- **Extendable** - Flux is built with extensibility in mind. You can easily add your own implementations of Flux's core components.

- **Testable** - Flux is built with testability in mind. You can easily mock Flux's components to test your applications.
