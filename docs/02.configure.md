# Configure Flux

In this documentation we will review the general installation, configuration and usage, regardless of which implementatin you choose. Refer to your implementation of choice for more information on how to use it.

## Installation

Install your [implementation](02.implementations.md) package of choice.

## Configure Flux

To configure Flux, you need to add it to your DI container. You can do this by calling the `AddFlux` extension method on your `IServiceCollection` instance.

```csharp
services.AddFlux(flux =>
{
    // Configure Flux here
});
```

When configuring Flux, you can add any amount of external services to it. Give each service a unique name. You can then configure each service by calling the `AddService` method on the `IFluxBuilder` instance.

```csharp
services.AddFlux(flux =>
{
    flux.AddService("service1");
    // Configure service1 here

    flux.AddService("service2");
    // Configure service2 here
});
```

## Example external service configuration

```csharp
services.AddFlux(flux =>
{
    flux.AddService("service1")
    .UsingRest("https://test.com")
    .AddSet<YourModel>()
        .WithEndpoint("model");
});
```
